- p: This is a test file for YTML, a way to write HTML in YAML.

- p: |
    Each key is always of type Scalar (string/number) or Sequence (list).
    There are no Maps/Objects because keys may not be unique. Take <li> for
    example, which wouldn't be possible if we didn't use lists, since you have
    to have multiple <li>'s as children of the same parent.
- ul:
    - li: List Item 1
    - li: List Item 2

- p: |  
    If a key is Scalar, it will become the text content of that element. The element
    will become a leaf node and be considered to have no children.
- b: Bold tag that only has a Scalar value!

- p: |
    If a key is a Sequence, it will have one or more child elements. Each child can also
    just be text content. Whatever is in the list will be appended to the parent's innerHTML
    in the order it was defined in the source YTML. If a parent element only has a single child,
    it still must be defined as a Sequence; in this case, a sequence of length 1.
    # multiple text nodes with "inline" bold tag
- p:
    - This has an inline
    - b: bold
    - tag, in YAML flow style.
- p: [This also has an inline, {b: bold}, "tag, in YAML block style."]

- p: |
    Attributes are declared in the key of the element, because YAML allows spaces, quotes, 
    and other characters to be keys. Attributes follow the same syntax rules as HTML - they must be
    separated by spaces, and be written as `attr="value"`. An exception exists when using the colon
    `:` character, which is a reserved character to denote a key in YAML. To not be read as a key,
    the colon must not have any whitespace to the immediate right of itself. For example, `style`
    attributes must be written like `style="font-size:16px;"` with no space next to the colon.
- button onclick="doThing()" style="background-color:blue": Click
- a href="https://www.google.com" role="button": Link to Google

- p: Elements can be specified using multiple lines by using YAML's "explicit key" syntax.
- ? a
    href="https://www.google.com"
    role="button"
    : Link to Google

- p: Text content can have multiple lines using YAML's multiline strings.
- script: |
    function doThing() {
      console.log('hello')
    }
